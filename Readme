The capability of a class to derive properties and characteristics from another class is called Inheritance.
Inheritance is one of the most important features of Object-Oriented Programming.
it means, the derived class inherits all the properties of the base class,
without changing the properties of base class and may add new features to its own.

Code Reusability

Generalization and Specialization: 

Inheritance helps in modeling real-world relationships where you have a general class
that represents common characteristics and specialized classes that represent more specific characteristics.
For example, you could have a base class Vehicle and derived classes like Car, Bicycle, and Truck.

is a member function that you expect to be redefined in derived classes.
When you refer to a derived class object using a pointer or a reference to the base class,
you can call a virtual function for that object and execute the derived class's version of the function.
